I will have given this talk on 26 January 2011.
The presentation, lii.html, is to be run using slippy: my.url/slippy/?file=lii.html

lii.html is just a hand-made edit of the example found in Slippy's source. I did not have the time or the inclination to learn how to generate HTML and all that jazz.
